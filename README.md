# Hackbook: OSINT and social network weaknesses

You suspect that your girlfriend Alexia is cheating on you. You would like to know if it is true. You find a strange social network called Hackbook. You decide to create an account and to try to find some information about Alexia...

For the 4 main challenges, you need to find the email and password of each account to access the flag. You should do the challenges in the following order : 1, 2, 3 then 4. They are all independent except 3rd one (you need to do at least one of the others). We advise you to respect the order. Throughout the challenge, a help bubble will give you clues.

For the 2 bonus challenges, there is no order. You can do them whenever you want, from any account.
